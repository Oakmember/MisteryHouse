How to use :
1) Create a new C++ based project ( not a blueprint based one) and copy this folder into /YourProject/Plugins/ so that this is a valid path :
 /YourProject/Plugins/UnrealToUnity/UnrealToUnity.uplugin

2) Add to this project all the assets you want to export, for example add the starter content to your project and open Minimal_Default
3) Click on the new UnityToUnreal button to get a submenu with
- Export... This will open a properties sheet with options:
RenderPipeline - exports shaders for Builtin/URP/HDRP
UseStandardShaders - Sets up all materials to use the Standard shader( or URP/Lit or HDRP/Lit ). If 2 textures exist for an output like BaseColor, only the first texture will be used.
ShowFBXExportDialog - Shows the FBX Export dialog where you have the option to not export LODs, VertexColors, collision. By default everything is exported.
ExportVertexShader - Exports the WorldPositionOffset part of the UE material. This is a new option and may result in shader errors if there's new material nodes
                     I didn't have time to fix yet. In case your export has shader errors, you can try exporting with this option turned off.

- PlaceAllAssetsInScene - If you have multiple maps or you just want all assets exported from a huge project that doesn't contain a scene, use this
to automatically spawn all static meshes into an empty map.
- ConvertLandscapesToStaticMeshes - Convert terrains into static meshes, use this prior to export. Take note it can modify materials used on other assets.
- PrepareForExport - in extremely rare cases, it is possible that the export process will hang when waiting for shader recompilations. For this case
you can first choose this option to prepare the materials. This will trigger the shader recompilations but won't export anything. After all shaders
have compiled you can choose an export option from above to continue the export.

The exporter exports an entire project to C:\UnrealToUnity\ for use with Unity 2019 and up.

4) Open the newly created project with Unity
5) In the root assets folder Asset\ there is either a FBX file or a Scene.unity file. For the FBX drag this into a new scene and delete default unity scene objects : MainCamera and DirectionalLight ( this
interfeers with unreal's default camera and lights )

Optional :
-if you want to reexport the same scene and want to make sure there's no errors you should delete the currently exported UnrealToUnity folder.

ConsoleOptions

utu.UseStandardMaterial - Sets up all materials to use the Standard shader( or URP/Lit or HDRP/Lit ). If 2 textures exist for an output like BaseColor, only the first texture will be used.
utu.MaxFoliageActors - Max foliage instance threshold so foliage export doesn't take hours. Default is 100000 instances. Set to 0 to export all. If the scene has over these many instances
				foliage export will be skipped.
utu.UsePrefabs - Generate and use prefab instances where appliable. If you have issues like gameobjects with missing meshes or missing materials in the scene
			you can try exporting with this option set to 0

Known Issues :
-It may crash during export if you don't have enough RAM, check your memory at the point of the crash dialog to figure this out. In situations like these just try to export again
because the memory increase is due to texture export which doesn't happen on subsequent tries if the texture is already exported.
-sometimes you may get an error on export depending on where the project is. Some users have had problems with projects located in their user documents folder or C:\Program Files
Try to place your project in a neutral folder like C:\NewUnrealProject
-On certain PCs the .NET Framework SDK 4.6.0 is not installed. This is a requirement apparently.
-ERROR: Windows SDK must be installed in order to build this target. - this is a requirement for UE4 C++ based projects. You must install all UE4 prerequisites and first make sure you can compile
 C++ based projects like the Kite Demo for example.
- Double check that this file resides exactly here /YourProject/Plugins/UnrealToUnity/UnrealToUnity.uplugin
- Do not name your test Project UnrealToUnity as Unreal can't load 2 modules with the same name (your game + plugin).
- if your system language is anything other than english you may get errors such as "error C2039: 'Names': 'FMaterialPreshaderData'?? ?????? ?ƴմϴ?." Try
changing your system language to english and try again. Also, do not use non-ASCII characters for the project name or assets.

Support

-if you have an error while trying to compile the plugin, there's a file at ProjectName/Saved/Logs/ProjectName.log . Send me this file at relativegames7@gmail.com
-if in unity you have white objects which stem from shader compilation errors send me screenshots with those errors at relativegames7@gmail.com
